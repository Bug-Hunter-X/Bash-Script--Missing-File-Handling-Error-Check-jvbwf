# This script attempts to process a file, but it has a subtle error.
# The problem lies in how it handles potential errors during file processing.

# Attempt to process the file.  Note the missing error handling.
process_file() {
  cat "$file_to_process" | while IFS= read -r line; do

    processed_line=$(echo $line | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')
    echo "Processed line: $processed_line"
  done
}

# Call the function to process the file
process_file

#The script will exit with an error code 1 if the file does not exist. 
#A more robust script should handle this gracefully.
# For example, check the file existence first, and handle case where file does not exist, provide error message and exit with a non-zero code
